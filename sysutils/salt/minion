# Set the location of the salt master server, if the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: {{ salt_master }}

# The minion can locally cache the return data from jobs sent to it, this
# can be a good way to keep track of jobs the minion has executed
# (on the minion side). By default this feature is disabled, to enable
# set cache_jobs to True
cache_jobs: True

# Backup files that are replaced by file.managed and file.recurse under
# 'cachedir'/file_backups relative to their original location and appended
# with a timestamp. The only valid setting is "minion". Disabled by default.
backup_mode: minion

# Run states when the minion daemon starts. To enable, set startup_states to:
# 'highstate' -- Execute state.highstate
# 'sls' -- Read in the sls_list option and execute the named sls files
# 'top' -- Read top_file option and execute based on that file on the Master
startup_states: 'highstate'

# Specify MySQL config file for Debian
mysql.default_file: '/etc/mysql/debian.cnf'

# Specify the default returner. Needed as a workaround for this bug :
